 <p>This page has all my work from the Animation section of the year. It contains Animation Background info, my rotoscoped animation, and my after effects animation. Animation background Info can be found on this page below and will give a brief description about the different types of animation and what features they. My rotoscoped animation can be found by clicking the the Animate logo below and found on the rotoscoping page. Finally my After Effects animation can be accessed by clicking the After ffects logo which takes you to my after effects page.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center">Animation Background Information:</h2>
<p1>Animation is the technique of creating successive drawings or positions of objects to create an illusion of movement when the film is shown in a sequence.
<br><br>
    
Animation has changed a lot with technology. As things have become more digital, animation has become easier and more complex. Now instead of people using traditional animation, they can make digital 3d animations. Technology has allowed animation to become quicker in creation as well as allowed more detail to be added in making them look better.	</p1>

<h3 style="text-align: center" >The Five Types of Animation:</h3>
<h4> Traditional Animation</h4>
<p1>Traditional animation is one of the older types of animation. Traditional animation entails the animator drawing every frame of the video that they want to animate. Traditional animation is a costly and time intensive process with big animations taking months to draw. Nowadays people still do traditional animation but with a computer rather than on paper. A famous example of traditional amination is the original Disney Mickey Mouse cartoons created by Walt Disney.</p1>

<h4>2D Vector Based Animation:</h4>
<p1>2D Vector Based Animation is referred to with hand drawn animation like Traditional animation but can also refer to computer vector animations. 2D Vector Based Animation uses the exact same techniques as Traditional Animation but are drawn and generated on a computer allowing for no physical objects needed as well as full access to all the computer tools and features.</p1>

<h4>3D Computer Animation:</h4>
<p1>3D Computer Animation is very different to the previous two types of animation. It still requires the knowledge of frame movement but rather than drawing the images it is more like using puppets. 3D Computer Animation can also be referred to as CGI or just CC. This type of animation is done by posting certain key frames of movement and the computer fills in the other gaps of movement. Famous examples of 3D Computer Animation are the animated movies such as Finding Nemo, the Shrek trilogy and Frozen.</p1>

<h4>Motion Graphics:</h4>
<p1>Motion graphics is very different to the other types of animation as the basic skills are completely different. Motion graphics is the process of moving graphic elements or texts to create an illusion of rotation or motion. Motion graphic animations are usually created using computer software where the computer animates images and texts using key frames that are tweened to make a smooth motion between the different frames. The sequence created is usually combined with audio afterwards. Motion graphics is usually associated with the creation of infomercials, comercials and other types of marketing videos.</p1>
    
<h4>Stop Motion</h4>
<p1>Stop Motion is a type of animation that entails a photo being taken of an object and then the object is moved slightly. When these images are put in a sequence an illusion of movement is created. Stop Motion is very similar to traditional animation but rather than drawings being changed it is objects that are changed instead. Stop Motion is a very long process as every image must have a slight image change to make a good illusion of motion. Famous types of stop motion include, Claymation, puppets, cut-out, silhouette, action figures or LEGO and pixilation.</p1>    

<h3 style="text-align: center" >Animation Key Words:</h3>
<h4>Frame Rate:</h4>
<p1>Frame rate or frames per second (fps) is the rate where frames appear consecutively in a row. For example, if a video’s frame rate is 12 then there would be 12 frames every second. If the frame rate was 24 then 24 frames would appear every second. In animation, people sometimes animate in ones or twos. Twos is when one image is shown for two frames. This is a way for animators to take up space in an animation making it longer. The more frames an animation uses per second the better it will look and flow. Common frame rates used are 12 fps, 24 fps, 30 fps and 60 fps.</p1>
    
<h4>Aspect Ratio:</h4>
    <p1>Aspect ratio is the ratio between the height and the width of an image. Common types of aspect ratios are 4:3, 16:9 and 2.35:1. 4:3 was commonly used for older shows as this what was the older televisions used to use. 16:9 is the most popular type as most definitions use this, as well as most tv shows, online videos and some films. 2.35:1 is most commonly used to give a cinematic look and is mostly used in movies. For animations, the majority are created using 16:9, which is the most common. This allows for any definition and best use of presentation.</p1>
    
<h4>Resolution:</h4>
<p1>Resolution is how many pixels make up an image. The more pixels the better the image will look. The most common types of resolutions are 480p, 720p, 1080p (HD) and 4k (ultra-high definition). The higher the resolution is the more time an image or animation video takes to render and produce. When deciding what resolution to use you must weigh up the look of the animation against the time, money and what screens can it be displayed on. For example, if it was a 4K animation only screens that allow 4K can view it in 4K. When doing animation, the best resolution would either be 720p or 1080p, allowing a good-looking animation but being able to be accessed by many machines as well.</p1>
    
<h4>File Types and Codec</h4>
<p1>The file type of an animation is the file the animation is exported as. Popular file types include, MP4, png, Gif, AVI, MPEG, swf, Mov, and Apng. Each file type is different and can be run using different software. For example, Windows Media player can run AVI and MPEG while Apple’s QuickTime player can run AVI, MPEG and Mov. When creating an animation, choosing the right file type is important. One of the best types is MP4 as it can run on most software’s and is available to choose in most programs.</p1>
